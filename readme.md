Charity Donation Platform

I built an online platform that makes it easy for people to donate things they donâ€™t need to trustworthy charities. The platform makes donating simple and clear for both donors and charities.

Administrator Profile: I added features that let administrators log in, manage other administrators, charities, and users. I also made it possible to keep track of donations and see their progress.

User Profile: I made it possible for users to sign up, log in securely, update their profiles, manage their donations, keep a record of past donations, recover their passwords, and make sure their passwords are strong.

Technologies Used: I used Spring Boot, Spring Form, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL, and Maven to build the platform.
